\section{Introduction}

Ganondorf is reborn an innumerable number of times in Zelda canon. He is very closely tied to the Triforce of Power, the upper third of the Triforce. The Triforce, of course, is the legendary relic that when completely assembled gives he who wields it anything he wishes. His connection to the Triforce of Power grants him strength equal to that of a God, which explain why he keeps coming back. \citep{1997MNRAS.287..591C}

The King of Darkness goes by the name Ganondorf when in his Gerudo/human form. However when he is portraying his pure embodiment of malice he simply goes by the name Ganon. This embodiment could look like a wild and ravage boar, a pure Calamity known as Calamity Ganon, or many other forms of hatred and evil.

\section{Observations}

Ganondorf has many other non-formal nicknames. Some of them are: King of Thieves, Gerudo King, King of Darkness, King of Demons, Dark Lord, Emperor of the Dark Realm, King of Evil.

Ganondorf was originally born as a Gerudo. This was a surprise since there hadn't been a male born Gerudo in hundreds of years.

\subsection{Lists}

There is a list:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ganondorf is awesome
    \item Ganondorf is also evil
\end{itemize}

The hero of the Legend of Zelda, Link, is the good-counterpart to Ganondorf's evil. He, along with his Master Sword, also known as the Blade of Evil's bane, has had to foil Ganondorf's devious plans to bring ruin to the land of Hyrule. \citep{2004DPS....36.3808W}

Link is connected to the Triforce of Courage through the power of the Gods. Zelda, the legendary princess, is the one who wields the thrid piece of the triforce. This piece is known as the Triforce of Wisdom.
